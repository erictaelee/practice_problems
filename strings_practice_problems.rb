# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).
# first_name = "Eric"
# last_name = "Lee"

# puts first_name + " " + last_name

# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).
# first_name = "Eric"
# last_name = "Lee"

# puts "#{first_name} #{last_name}"

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".
# word = gets.chomp
# if word == "marco"
#   puts "polo"
# end  


# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).
# color_1 = "red"
# color_2 = "blue"
# color_3 = "green"

# puts color_1 + " " + color_2 + " " + color_3

# puts "enter a name"
# name = gets.chomp
# if name != "Santa"
#   puts "You're not Santa"

# 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).
# title = "Harry Potter"
# author = "JK Rowling"

# puts author + " wrote " + title

# # 8. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string interpolation (the #{} operator).
# title = "Harry Potter"
# author = "JK Rowling"

# puts "#{author} wrote #{title}"


# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"
# puts "enter a password"
# password = gets.chomp
# if password == "Joshua"
#   puts "Shall we play a game?"
